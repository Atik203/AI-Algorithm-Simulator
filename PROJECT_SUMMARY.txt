AI ALGORITHM SIMULATOR
======================

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
A free, open-source web platform for visualizing AI search and optimization algorithms 
in real-time with interactive step-by-step demonstrations.

IMPLEMENTED ALGORITHMS (7):

Classic Search (4):
• A* Search - Optimal pathfinding (O(b^d) time, admissible heuristic)
• Breadth-First Search - Level-order traversal (O(V+E) time, optimal for unweighted)
• Depth-First Search - Deep exploration (O(V+E) time, uses backtracking)
• Dijkstra's Algorithm - Weighted shortest path (O((V+E)logV) time, optimal)

Heuristic & Optimization (3):
• Hill Climbing - Local search (O(1) space, greedy approach)
• Simulated Annealing - Probabilistic optimization (accepts worse moves)
• Genetic Algorithm - Evolutionary optimization (O(g×n×f) time)

TECH STACK:
Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Django 5.1, Python 3.11+, Django REST Framework, JWT Auth

FEATURES:
✓ Real-time visualization with playback control (0.1x - 10x speed)
✓ Interactive grid editor with custom obstacles & mazes
✓ Performance metrics (nodes explored, execution time, path cost)
✓ Multiple heuristics (Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebyshev, Octile)
✓ User authentication & simulation history
✓ Responsive design with dark mode support

COMING SOON (7 More):
Bidirectional BFS, Depth-Limited DFS, Iterative Deepening DFS, 
Uniform Cost Search, Stochastic Hill Climbing, Random Restart Hill Climbing,
First-Choice Hill Climbing
