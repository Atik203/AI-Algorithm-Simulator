# UI/UX Updates Summary

## Completed Updates - October 15, 2025

### 1. History Page - List View Update ✅

**Changes Made:**

- Converted grid layout to modern list view with horizontal cards
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with gradient icons and better spacing
- Improved statistics display in a grid format within each card
- Added hover animations (horizontal slide effect)
- Better mobile responsiveness with flexible grid layout

**Key Features:**

- **Icon Section**: Gradient background with simulation type icon
- **Main Content**: 4-column responsive grid layout
  - Column 1: Algorithm name, type, and status badge
  - Column 2-3: Statistics grid (nodes, path cost, moves, board size, execution time)
  - Column 4: Date and delete action
- **Visual Enhancements**:
  - Success/failure status badges with semantic colors
  - Compact statistic cards with icons
  - Clean, professional layout

### 2. Backend - Game History Saving ✅

**Changes Made:**

- Updated `play_game` endpoint in `backend/algorithms_app/views.py`
- Added simulation saving logic for all three game types:
  - **Tic-Tac-Toe**: Saves with algorithm (minimax/alphabeta), game history length, winner status
  - **Tower of Hanoi**: Saves with disk count, total moves, execution time
  - **Connect4**: Saves with nodes explored, execution time

**Implementation:**

```python
# Save simulation if requested and user is authenticated
if request.data.get("save_simulation") and request.user.is_authenticated:
    Simulation.objects.create(
        user=request.user,
        simulation_type="connect4",  # or "tic-tac-toe", "tower-of-hanoi"
        algorithm="connect4",
        nodes_explored=result.get("nodes_explored", 0),
        execution_time=result.get("execution_time", 0),
        total_moves=result.get("total_moves", 0),
        path_found=True,
        solved=True/False,
    )
```

### 3. Frontend - API Integration ✅

**Changes Made:**

- Updated `GamePlayRequest` interface in `frontend/src/api/api.ts`
- Added `save_simulation?: boolean` field
- Updated game components to pass `save_simulation: true`:
  - **TowerOfHanoiVisualizer**: All solve operations now saved
  - **TicTacToe**: AI vs AI games saved to history
  - **Connect4**: Ready for future game completion saves

**Type Definition:**

```typescript
export interface GamePlayRequest {
  game_type: "tic-tac-toe" | "tower-of-hanoi" | "connect4";
  save_simulation?: boolean;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 4. Tower of Hanoi - Button Styling ✅

**Changes Made:**

- Updated "Solve Puzzle" button gradient from purple-pink to blue
- Changed from `from-purple-500 to-pink-500` to `from-blue-500 to-blue-600`
- Maintains consistency with other control buttons in the application

**Before:**

```tsx
className = "... bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-pink-500 ...";
```

**After:**

```tsx
className = "... bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-blue-600 ...";
```

## Database Model Status ✅

The `Simulation` model already includes all necessary types:

```python
SIMULATION_TYPE_CHOICES = [
    ("pathfinding", "Pathfinding"),
    ("8-puzzle", "8-Puzzle"),
    ("n-queens", "N-Queens"),
    ("sudoku", "Sudoku"),
    ("tic-tac-toe", "Tic-Tac-Toe"),
    ("tower-of-hanoi", "Tower of Hanoi"),
    ("connect4", "Connect 4"),
]
```

## Dashboard Integration Status ✅

Dashboard already has proper icon mappings for all simulation types including Connect4:

```typescript
case "tic-tac-toe":
case "connect4":
  return <Gamepad2 className="h-5 w-5" />;
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test Connect4 game completion and verify it appears in History page
- [ ] Test Tic-Tac-Toe AI vs AI and verify it appears in History page
- [ ] Test Tower of Hanoi solve and verify it appears in History page
- [ ] Verify list view displays correctly on mobile devices
- [ ] Check that Dashboard shows game statistics correctly
- [ ] Verify all simulation types display with correct icons
- [ ] Test delete functionality in new list view layout

## Files Modified

### Backend:

1. `backend/algorithms_app/views.py` - Added save_simulation logic to play_game endpoint

### Frontend:

1. `frontend/src/pages/History.tsx` - Converted to list view layout
2. `frontend/src/api/api.ts` - Added save_simulation field to GamePlayRequest
3. `frontend/src/components/game/TowerOfHanoiVisualizer.tsx` - Added save_simulation: true, changed button color
4. `frontend/src/components/game/TicTacToe.tsx` - Added save_simulation: true to AI vs AI

## Notes

- Games now properly save to history when `save_simulation: true` is passed
- History page displays all simulation types in a modern list view
- Individual game moves (Connect4, TicTacToe) don't save each move, only complete games
- Tower of Hanoi saves every solution automatically
- Backend already had all necessary models and choices configured
- All visualizers now have consistent UI with the common components system
