# AI Algorithm Simulator - Project Description

## Overview

AI Algorithm Simulator is a free, open-source interactive web platform for visualizing and understanding AI search and optimization algorithms through real-time, step-by-step demonstrations.

## Current Features (7 Algorithms Implemented)

### Classic Search Algorithms:

1. A\* Search - Optimal pathfinding with heuristics
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) - Level-order graph traversal
3. Depth-First Search (DFS) - Deep exploration with backtracking
4. Dijkstra's Algorithm - Shortest path for weighted graphs

### Heuristic & Optimization Algorithms:

5. Hill Climbing - Local search optimization
6. Simulated Annealing - Probabilistic optimization
7. Genetic Algorithm - Evolution-based optimization

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Django 5.1 + Python 3.11, Django REST Framework, JWT Auth
- **Database**: SQLite/PostgreSQL

## Key Capabilities

✅ Real-time step-by-step visualization
✅ Interactive grid with custom obstacles and mazes
✅ Performance metrics (nodes explored, execution time, path cost)
✅ Multiple heuristic options (Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebyshev, Octile)
✅ Playback speed control (0.1x - 10x)
✅ User authentication and simulation history
✅ Responsive design with dark mode
✅ Free & Open Source

## Coming Soon

7 additional algorithms including Bidirectional BFS, Depth-Limited DFS, Iterative Deepening DFS, Uniform Cost Search, and various Hill Climbing variants.

## Use Cases
