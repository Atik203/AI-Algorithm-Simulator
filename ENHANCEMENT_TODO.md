## 📝 Notes from Senior Review

1. **Theme Toggle:** Three-state toggle is confusing for users. Change to simple dark/light toggle.
2. **Cursor States:** Missing pointer cursors make UI feel unresponsive.
3. **Hover Effects:** Current hover effects are too subtle. Add clear visual feedback.
4. **Animations:** Register page quality should be standard across all pages.
5. **Algorithm Coverage:** Reference folder has 15 algorithms, but only 6 are shown. Add all.
6. **Navigation:** Users need clear way to navigate between simulator features.
7. **Loading States:** Add skeleton loaders and progress indicators.
8. **Error Handling:** Use toast notifications consistently for better UX.
